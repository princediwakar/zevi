# Zevi — Strategic Review & Pivot Options

> Written: February 2026  
> Context: App is built, zero users, no PM network, starting GTM from scratch.

## The Core Problem with the Current Direction

Zevi is currently positioned as a **B2C consumer habit app** in a space where:

- Distribution is expensive (paid social, ASO, SEO takes months)
- Retention is inherently episodic — users engage for 4–6 weeks during a job hunt, then churn
- No existing network to seed early users organically
- Incumbents (Exponent, IGotAnOffer, RocketBlocks) have years of SEO, community, and brand

As a solo developer with no PM network, this is the hardest possible GTM path.

## Three Strategic Pivots

### Option A: Pivot to B2B — Sell to Bootcamps & Courses *(Lowest Resistance)*

**The idea:** PM bootcamps (Product School, Reforge, General Assembly, Maven course creators) need practice tools for their students. They have the audience. You have the tool.

- Instead of acquiring users one by one, license the platform to a bootcamp with 200 students
- Their instructors become a referral / distribution channel
- Charge per seat or a flat platform fee
- **What you'd need to change:** White-label branding, instructor dashboard, cohort progress tracking
- **Why it works:** You can reach 10–20 bootcamp founders on LinkedIn via cold outreach. No brand needed — just a demo.

### Option B: Sharpen the Positioning — Niche Down to ONE Persona

Right now Zevi is "PM interview prep" — too broad. The sharpest version:

> **"The only app built specifically for engineers transitioning to PM."**

**Why engineers → PM?**
- This is the #1 path into PM roles at FAANG/top tech companies
- They're technically strong but weak on frameworks (metrics, strategy, GTM)
- They search specifically for this content: "APM program prep," "engineer to PM"
- Reddit communities (r/ProductManagement, r/cscareerquestions) are full of them and they're willing to pay for structured frameworks
- This doesn't require changing the product — just the messaging, content focus, and where you show up

**GTM:** Post genuinely helpful content in these communities with a soft link. No spam — real value first.

### Option C: Kill the Consumer App — Build an AI Interview Simulation API *(Contrarian, Bigger Market)*

**The insight:** The most valuable part of what you've built isn't the app UI — it's the **AI feedback pipeline** (Whisper + GPT scoring answers against rubrics).

That's an API businesses would pay for:
- Hiring platforms (Greenhouse, Lever) want automated PM candidate pre-screening
- Recruiting agencies want to assess candidates at scale
- LinkedIn / Handshake-type platforms want "practice interviews" as a feature

This is a harder pivot but a much larger market. The app becomes a demo / proof of concept.

## Recommendation: What to Actually Do (Next 4 Weeks)

**Combine Option A + B:**

1. **Reposition** as "PM prep for engineers transitioning to PM" — update app store copy, landing page, all messaging
2. **Post 3–5 genuinely helpful threads** on r/ProductManagement and r/cscareerquestions — no spam, real value, soft link at the end
3. **Cold DM 10 Maven / Gumroad PM course creators** — offer free access in exchange for feedback + potential white-label partnership
4. **If one bootcamp bites** — double down on B2B, build the instructor dashboard

**The goal:** Get 50 real users within 30 days through community + partnerships, not ads. Validate willingness to pay at $9–15/month before investing more.

## Decision Trigger

> If you can't get 50 users through community + cold outreach in 30 days, that's a strong signal to pivot harder toward Option C (API / B2B infrastructure) or reconsider the space entirely.

## Competitive Landscape Summary

| Player | Strength | Weakness |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Exponent | Strong brand, video content | Passive learning, no AI feedback |
| IGotAnOffer | SEO, written guides | No interactivity |
| RocketBlocks | Good exercises | Dated UX, expensive |
| **Zevi** | AI feedback pipeline, mobile-native | No distribution, no brand |

**Zevi's only real moat:** AI-scored framework application at scale. Double down on that or find a B2B buyer for it.

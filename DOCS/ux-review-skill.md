Do a comprehensive UX review of this application from a product strategy and design thinking perspective.

**Product Context:**
- Target Users: [who uses this]
- Core Problem Solved: [what value does it provide]
- Platform: [web/mobile/desktop]

Explore the codebase, analyze the UI/UX implementation, and provide:

1. **Strategic UX Assessment**
   - Does the UX support the product's value proposition?
   - What's the biggest UX risk to user adoption?

2. **User Journey Analysis**
   - Map the critical user flows
   - Identify friction points and drop-off risks

3. **Design Thinking Evaluation**
   - User empathy gaps (where are we missing user needs?)
   - Mental model mismatches
   - Jobs-to-be-done alignment

4. **Prioritized Issues**
   - Critical (blocks core value)
   - High (significant friction)
   - Medium (polish opportunities)

5. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Quick wins (this sprint)
   - Near-term (2-4 weeks)
   - Strategic (2-3 months)

Analyze the actual implementation - routes, components, UI code, navigation structure, forms, etc.
